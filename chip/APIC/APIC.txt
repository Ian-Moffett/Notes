APIC performs two primary functions for the processor:
- It receives interrupts from the processor’s interrupt pins, from internal sources and from an external I/O APIC
  (or other external interrupt controller). It sends these to the processor core for handling.

- In multiple processor (MP) systems, it sends 
  and receives interprocessor interrupt 
  (IPI) messages to and from
  other logical processors on the system bus. IPI 
  messages can be used to 
  distribute interrupts among the
  processors in the system or 
  to execute system wide functions (such as, booting up processors or distributing
  work among a 
  group of processors).

  The external I/O APIC is part of Intel’s system chip set. Its primaryfunction is to receive external interrupt events
from the system and its associated I/O devices and relay them to the local APIC as interrupt messages. In MP
systems, the I/O APIC also provides a mechanism for distributing external interrupts to the local APICs of selected
processors or groups of processors on the system bus.
This chapter provides a description of the local APIC and its programming interface. It also provides an overview of
the interface between the local APIC and the I/O APIC. Contact Intel for detailed information about the I/O APIC.

When a local APIC has sent an interrupt to its processor core for handling, the processor uses the interrupt and
exception handling mechanism described in Chapter 6, “Interrupt and Exception Handling.” see interrupts/interrupts.txt
“Interrupt and Exception Overview,” for an introduction to interrupt and exception handling.
